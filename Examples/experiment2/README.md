# Searching For Office Directory Using Appropriate Data Structure  

## Overview  
You will design a user interface of an office directory for an office building. Your program will prompt the user for a room number and print the last-name of the faculty in that office room (only if it exists in the directory). For example, since Prof. Leng’s office is located in room 119, if the user types '119' at the prompt, your program will print ‘Leng’.
